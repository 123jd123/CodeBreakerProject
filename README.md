# Work in progress

Please note, at this time this project is not yet complete. While you are welcome to watch this project grow, at this point it's not yet ready for use. Thank you for your interest in Codeschool Projects!

# Use Javascript to Create a "Code Breaker" Game

You'll build a Code Breaker game using Javascript. The game will randomly generate a hidden code and the player gets 10 attempts to guess that code based on provided feedback. (based of the Mastermind board game)

# Getting Started

To get started with this project, head over to the [Link to Repository](https://www.codeschool.com/projects/CodeBreaker) project on Code School, and begin! It'll walk you through all of the steps below. They're included here in the readme in case you work better locally, or want to try working on this project offline.

<!-- Place Screen Shot of game here -->

# What You'll Use

- Javascript
- DOM elements
- Loops
- Conditions
- Expressions

# What You'll Learn

You will further your Javascript skills, as well as become more comfortable writing Javascript code to create an entertaining game.

# Live Demo

[Check out this link] (#) to see a working version of this project. Feel free to alter and expand on this project to make your own twist on the Code Breaker game once you've completed the steps.

You'll build a Code Breaker game that you can play and show off to others as an example of your abilities in Javascript.

# Setup Instructions

Once you have cloned the forked repository, go into the directory containing the project and look for the `/src` directory. This is the directory where you will be making changes when you start the following step-by-step instructions. You can simply open those files in a text editor to get started.

In this project, all of your changes will happen in the file called `/src/assets/main.js`.

# Tasks

Complete the following tasks to finish this project.

# Next Steps

Now that you've completed this project, you should make it available online so you can share your progress with others! One way to do this is by using GitHub Pages.

To deploy your `/src` directory to GitHub Pages, be sure to commit all of your changes and make a new branch called `gh-pages`. Once you are checked into the `gh-pages` branch, run the following command:

```git subtree push --prefix src origin gh-pages```

This will push the `src` folder up to GitHub on the `gh-pages` branch. After that, you hsould be able to open up `http://username.github.io/CodeBreakerProject`, where `username` is your GitHub username.
